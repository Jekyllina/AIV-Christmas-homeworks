# Data Structures 
Exercises with data structures in C  AIV

1) dynamic array with the append and remove methods refactored for reduce the realloc calls by using a capacity value
2) linked list with remove and reverse methods implemented 
3) doubly linked list with implementation of remove method and two insert methods: before or after an item of the list
4) sets with implementation of various methods: print, search and remove. Added a control on the insert method: if the key already exist, you can't add that element again
